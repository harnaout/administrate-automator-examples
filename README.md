# Administrate Automator Examples

A collection of workflow examples for [Administrate Automator](https://support.getadministrate.com/hc/en-us/articles/41797081434513-Administrate-Automator), demonstrating how to automate common tasks and build custom integrations with Administrate.

## What is Automator?

Administrate Automator lets you automate your work in Administrate - everything from custom workflows to integrations with systems and custom tools unique to your organization. Build automations that eliminate manual tasks, connect your systems, and scale your operations without adding headcount.

Automator is powered by n8n, a powerful workflow automation platform that we've white-labeled and integrated directly into Administrate.

2. **Browse the examples** below to find workflows that solve your challenges
3. **Download the workflow JSON** file from the example directory
4. **Import into Automator** using the import function in your n8n interface
5. **Configure credentials** and customize as needed for your organization
